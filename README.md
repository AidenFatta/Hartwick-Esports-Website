This was a project developed by me and a few classmates apart of a class taken at Hartwick College. This project was a website created to host content and information about the college's official esports team. The project was developed and hosted using AWS services. These files represent an incomplete version of the project as these are only the files I worked on myself. They have connections to AWS databases that aren't currently active to my knowledge. Additionally some information content may be out of date as this was created and last updated Fall 2024
